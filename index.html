            <h2>Our goal at Parents A.S.D Resources, is to give parents of children with a recent diagnosis of autism
                spectrum disorder, an idea of things to expect, things to look out for and methods to make your childrens
                everyday lives easier to navigate.

            <h2 class="about-box-heading">What you can do <i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Upon receiving your childs diagnosis, google searches on autism, facebook page comments and your aunts friends neighbours opinion, can all be at lot to take in. <br>
                Based on real parents experiences submit to us through our contact page, we complie a top ten list of the most common "what we wish we knew at the beginning of this journey.
                We separate the useful from the useless information to save you time and stress. 
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="about-box">
            <h2 class="about-box-heading">What you can use <i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Learn how regular toys and books, not just expensive sensory equipent, can be used as tools to teach an array of tasks that would typically be the first things an assigned S.L.T or O.T would have your child undertake. <br>
                So before you rush out to buy the latest fad and light-up gadgets(which are good sensory seeking fun in all fairness!) read our list what can be used and for what.  
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class=" about-box float-right">
            <h2 class="about-box-heading">What you can teach yourself <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Almost 90% of the work required for your child to make progress will come from the work you do. The other 10% will be the work your O.T and S.L.T will show you. <br>Although the internet may  be awash with nonsense, there is a wealth of knowledge on A.S.D if you know where to look and what to trust. <br>So each week we share our recommended video, this might be a TED talk or instructional video. And monthly we share our recommended book.
