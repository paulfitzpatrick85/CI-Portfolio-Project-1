## Homepage.
On the homepage users will find a brief introduction of the three catagories that the site addresses, along with links to a its resources page and signup form.


## Theme.
The color scheme of the header, footer and body where chosen to work around and play off the main hero image of the home page, and maintain the positive feel of the home page image throughout the pages that follow it.

## 'What you can do' and 'What you can use' sections.
The main idea behind this website is that the ideas outlined are shortlisted for other users (as in other parents that have used the site or from the related social media sites) submitted recommendations.
- The first section being what the users/parents can do to by themselves ie, educate themselves in the topic of ASD and also the mindset to approach the topic.

- The second section show what items can be used for what purposes and also includes a link to an external website for a parents course in communication called "Hanen:more than more".

## Recommened section.

1. Ted Talk video from youtube.
2. A book from amazon.

## Signup form
