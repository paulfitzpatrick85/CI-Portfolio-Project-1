View the finished website here - https://paulfitzpatrick85.github.io/CI-Portfolio-Project-1/

The Parents A.S.D Resources website is intended as a source of clear and practical information for parents of children recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, namely what they can do themselves for their children in the interim of waiting times for state provided and private services.

## Theme.
The color scheme of the header, footer and body where chosen to work around and play off the main hero image of the home page, and maintain the positive feel of the home page image throughout the pages that follow it.

## 'What you can do' and 'What you can use' sections.
The main idea behind this website is that the ideas outlined are shortlisted from other users (as in other parents that have used the site or from the related social media sites) submitted recommendations.
- The first section being what the users/parents can do to by themselves ie, educate themselves in the topic of ASD and also the mindset to approach the topic.

The layout for large screens is made to appear as four blocks, with the text and images of each section diagonal from one another.
And as this would not work on smaller screens, the order of the sections were reversed to appear as text/image/text/image as the user scrolls down the screen. 
- The second section shows what items can be used for what purposes and also includes a link to an external website for a parents course in communication called "Hanen:more than words".

## Recommened section.
This section contains two embedded links. 
1. Ted Talk video from youtube.
2. A book from amazon.
With it being stated on the homepage that these recommendations change weekly and monthly, with the idea of obviously trying to help the user, but also ensure users return to the site regulary.

## Signup form

A page were users can signup for a newsletter, enter details that the site owner can use to better understand the users situation (childs age, how often they attend services), and also a text area to submit comments and tips etc for the site to make its list for the resources page.

At the bottom of each page, the footer has social media icons linking to each sites homepage (as this is a ficitous site with without actual social media profiles).

## Testing section
I tested and confirmed the three pages are responsive to screen sizes as small as 325px.

I tested my html on the w3c vaildator and found all code to be all ok once I removed three stray closing tags from the footer icons. 

I also tested my css on jigsaw and everything was perfect first time.

I confirmed that the signup form cannot be submitted without a name and correct type email, the other sections are not required because of the nature of the site, eg some users-parents in this case may not be at the point of looking for therapists or even know they need one yet.

I tested the sites accessibility through lighthouse, the image below showing the results.

## Bugs found while creaing and testing
A large number of breakpoints had to be used to allow for correct reponsiveness across screen sizes to maintain the sites structural intregrity.
