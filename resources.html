            <h2>What you can do</h2>
            <h4>The wait times for public services can sadly range from months to evens years. But there is plenty you as parents can do in the mean time.</h4>
            <br>
            <ul id="to-do-list">
                <li><strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> Wait times for state services, and even some private therapys, can be quite long, so do some digging, there are plenty of great books and youtube videos explaining what to expect and what you can do. </li>
                <li><strong>Capatilize on the childs interest:</strong> Your child likes planes? Great! Get them a lego car to work on fine motor skills, a colouring book of cars to work on pencil grip, make playdough planes. <br>Whatever the interest, use it to encourage engagement with you. </li>
                <li><strong>Focus on strenghts:</strong> Don't get hung up on want your child can't do at the moment, focus on what they can do and build it from there, and remember some things take longer than others for all kids, on the spectrum or not.</li>

            <h2>What you can use</h2>
            <h4>When you begin to attend S.L.T and O.T services, you'll find that they use items that are simple and inexpensive.</h4>
            <br>
            <ul id="use-list">
                <li>Shape stacking boards can be used for much more than just a fine motor skils exercise;
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shapes & colours: ask your child to give you the "red circle" then the "blue square" etc.</li>
                        <li>Turn taking: Parents turn to fit a piece, child turn to fit a piece, stating clearly whos turnit is each time. </li>
                    </ol>
                </li> 
                <li>As recommended in the <strong><a href="http://www.hanen.org/Programs/For-Parents/More-Than-Words.aspx">Hanen: more than words</a></strong> course for parents, getting down to your childs eye level is imperative if they are to understand what your asking of them.</li>
                <li>Pegboards: great fine motor development, again learn shapes and colours, and in this example, prepositions: <br> Whats behind the red square? An apple! etc</li>
                <li>Visual Shedules: Dont underestimate there effectiveness, imagine how images could help you when when asking for directions in a non-english country? The same idea applies!</li>
